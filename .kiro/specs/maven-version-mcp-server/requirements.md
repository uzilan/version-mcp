# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Maven Version MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides dependency version management capabilities for Java projects using Maven and Gradle build systems. The server will integrate with mvnrepository.com to fetch the latest version information for Java dependencies and enable automated dependency updates in project files. This tool will be configurable with development environments like Kiro to streamline dependency management workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Maven or Gradle, I want to search for Java dependencies by name, so that I can discover available packages and their versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a dependency name THEN the system SHALL search mvnrepository.com for matching artifacts
2. WHEN search results are found THEN the system SHALL return a list of matching artifacts with their group IDs, artifact IDs, and descriptions
3. WHEN no search results are found THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate message indicating no matches
4. WHEN the search query is empty or invalid THEN the system SHALL return an error message with usage guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to retrieve the latest version of a specific Maven dependency, so that I can use the most current stable release in my project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests the latest version for a specific group ID and artifact ID THEN the system SHALL fetch the current latest version from mvnrepository.com
2. WHEN the dependency exists THEN the system SHALL return the latest version number, release date, and version details
3. WHEN the dependency does not exist THEN the system SHALL return an error message indicating the artifact was not found
4. WHEN mvnrepository.com is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message about service availability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to retrieve all available versions of a Maven dependency, so that I can choose a specific version that meets my project requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests all versions for a specific group ID and artifact ID THEN the system SHALL fetch the complete version history from mvnrepository.com
2. WHEN versions are found THEN the system SHALL return a list of all versions sorted by release date (newest first)
3. WHEN the dependency exists but has no versions THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate message
4. WHEN the request includes version filtering criteria THEN the system SHALL return only versions matching the criteria

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using Maven, I want to automatically update dependency versions in my pom.xml file, so that I can keep my project dependencies current without manual editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to update a dependency in a Maven project THEN the system SHALL locate the pom.xml file
2. WHEN the dependency exists in pom.xml THEN the system SHALL update the version to the specified or latest version
3. WHEN the dependency does not exist in pom.xml THEN the system SHALL add the dependency with the specified version
4. WHEN the pom.xml file is malformed THEN the system SHALL return an error without modifying the file
5. WHEN the update is successful THEN the system SHALL preserve the original file formatting and structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using Gradle, I want to automatically update dependency versions in my build.gradle file, so that I can keep my project dependencies current without manual editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to update a dependency in a Gradle project THEN the system SHALL locate the build.gradle or build.gradle.kts file
2. WHEN the dependency exists in the build file THEN the system SHALL update the version to the specified or latest version
3. WHEN the dependency does not exist in the build file THEN the system SHALL add the dependency with the specified version to the appropriate configuration block
4. WHEN the build file is malformed THEN the system SHALL return an error without modifying the file
5. WHEN the update is successful THEN the system SHALL preserve the original file formatting and structure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer using development tools like Kiro, I want to configure the Maven Version MCP Server, so that I can integrate dependency management into my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is configured THEN the system SHALL expose standard MCP protocol endpoints
2. WHEN tools connect to the server THEN the system SHALL provide available tools and their schemas
3. WHEN the server receives MCP tool calls THEN the system SHALL execute the requested operations and return results in MCP format
4. WHEN the server encounters errors THEN the system SHALL return properly formatted MCP error responses
5. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the Playwright browser automation for web scraping

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to handle web scraping reliably, so that dependency information is consistently available even with website changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server needs to fetch data from mvnrepository.com THEN the system SHALL use Playwright for reliable web automation
2. WHEN the website structure changes THEN the system SHALL handle parsing errors gracefully and return appropriate error messages
3. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN the server is rate-limited THEN the system SHALL respect rate limits and implement appropriate delays
5. WHEN browser automation fails THEN the system SHALL clean up resources and return error information
